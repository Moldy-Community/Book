# History

Moldy was created thanks to the need to have a structure to start any project for example: You want to create a CLI in Python for that most of the CLI have their own structures but Moldy wants to standardize that and also advertise to new languages with project templates and of new languages

## Why moldy?

Moldy alludes to the word "Mold in Spanish" because its objective is to create project templates (and rush a create-react-app sshh don't tell anyone) and we add a "Y" to make this name more familiar. it was my own the name was created by a friend who prefers to be anonymous

## Use

Moldy is designed for people with a minimum knowledge of CLI, therefore its use and commands are the simplest and most complete, in case a documentation is needed, it is in the process of being created when the documentation is ready I will place the link here in the in case you want to help with the documentation it is intended to be done with mdbook the documentation is [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) any contribution is welcome.

## Philosophy

A simple but powerful tool without thousands of commands but in case you need them to develop a template you can read the devs part in the future documentation, in the future it is planned to create a GUI for Moldy in case you want to help with that you can enter the discord link in which they will talk about mold and the new features
